Hi Folks! Jos here!

I'm pleased to say that we are finally gonna give you guys some consistent updates! ðŸŽ‰

May has been a funky whirlwind of context-switching between revamping POLDERS' core gameplay loop, giving presentations about our progress, and diving deep into the rabbit hole of web development. And you know what? I'm having an absolute blast! There's something oddly satisfying about juggling these completely different tasks - one moment I'm knee-deep in game systems code, the next I'm fiddling with CSS animations (and questioning my life choices), and then suddenly I'm in front of people trying to explain why flooding the Netherlands in a video game is actually a good thing. It's wild, it's varied, and it's exactly the kind of creative chaos I thrive in!

#### New Video
We added a new video to showcase some pre-alpha gameplay! Dani made it, and bless her, it's so much better than my previous attempt ^^'. [You can watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzYt_z4o8ro).

#### Website overhaul!
We got a new website, you are looking at it! We lacked a clear overview of the POLDERS project, and we wanted to start posting updates like this one. I probably took too long cooking it up, but I couldn't resist giving it some stylistic love :) Feel free to take a look around

#### Presentations
It's also apparently the season of presentations! Last month it was Everything Procedural, last week, it was Rust Week.
If you are interested in some technical details of POLDERS, [you can find the Rust Week presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/live/84bX1nPDBr4?feature=shared&t=5627)

#### Did you know that...
You can read the mood of Dutch windmills based on their windblades?! See the image below: The resting position of the blades can either be in a state of joy (1), of mourning (2), of short rest (3) or a long rest (4). A windmill with clothed blades stopped in an X means an urgent gathering at the windmill (5), and apparently the Frysians like to put flags all around their windmills during festivities (6). Now you know what that cute windmill on the top of a dike is trying to hint to you :)

Hi Polderaars!

Here's another fresh polder update! The weather's getting pretty muggy, but that's not stopping us from steadily grinding away on this awesome passion project:

#### POLDERVLOG
Guys, we finally made a personal vlog! ðŸŽ¬ This is really where it all started - our pure love for the Netherlands and our crazy obsession with windmills and dikes. [Here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kECn8C7ZWRk).

#### Villagers & Automation 
The automation system is finally starting to take shape and man, this is so much fun to play with. 

Your villagers aren't boring NPCs just wandering around anymore - nope, these guys have WORK to do! They sail back and forth with barges, operate windmills (that actually work btw!), haul goods around, and keep an eye on your dikes. Because yeah, if your dikes fail...

#### Shading
This month we really went deep on the visual side of the game. 

We want POLDERS to look like Van Ruisdael and Vermeer themselves were the art directors. No joke! Those Dutch masters really understood what our landscape looks like - that vastness, that light, those typical Dutch clouds. 

So we're staying up late into the night messing around with grass shaders and vegetation rendering. The goal? That you really feel like you're walking around in a 17th-century Dutch landscape. With meadows that look nice and green, grass that moves in the wind, and that characteristic Dutch light.

#### Did you know...
That peat soil is horrible to build on? Yet practically a fourth of the Netherlands is built on top of this swampy stuff, including Amsterdam!

Picture this: you want to build a house, but the ground is as soft as a water-soaked sponge. Your house just sinks away! Or tilts. Or both. That's exactly why our ancestors had to get so creative. Ramming wooden piles into the ground, and keeping the water level just right. And that in the 17th century!

Try building a windmill on bad ground - then you'll quickly learn why the Netherlands got so good at "how to build something that doesn't fall over". It's not for nothing that we're worldwide experts in difficult construction projects. We HAD to get good, otherwise we would've literally sunk!
